This repo contains python3 bioinformatics utilities I find useful.

**Installation**

This package is written in python3. pip can be used to install it:

``pip3 install --verbose -r requirements.txt``

If possible, I recommend installing inside a virtual environment. See
[here](http://www.simononsoftware.com/virtualenv-tutorial-part-2/>), for example.


**Usage**

Please see the [docs](docs/bio.md) for details about the command line usage.

**Uninstallation**

The `bio_utils` package can be removed with pip.

```
pip3 uninstall bio_utils
```
